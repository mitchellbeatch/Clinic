This program manages a database of patients, their information, and notes written during appointments.
The menu bar at the top of the screen allows the user to log out, plus create, retrieve, update, and delete patients. 
Once an appointment has started for any given patient, the user can create, retrieve, update and delete notes, which are stored
and automatically assigned timestamps and codes in the Patient Record.
Additionally, this program is password protected, with a remember password feature.

Username: user
